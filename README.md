# Web Components

## What this repo is all about

This repo contains code for common front-end webcomponents like navbars , accordions, carousels , tabs etc written in just vanilla javascript and css.
It should be noted that the components in this repo aren't **_written to be used as a library_**. There aren't any class based constructors or methods used to initialize a component.

Many of the components are based on [snippets from W3Schools' How to section](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/)
